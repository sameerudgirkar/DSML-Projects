# # Walmart Business Case Study - Confidence Interval and CLT

# **Business Problem**

# The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).

# **Dataset**

# The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset has the following features:

# - User_ID    :	User ID
# - Product_ID :	Product ID
# - Gender     :	Sex of User
# - Age        :	Age in bins
# - Occupation :	Occupation(Masked)
# - City_Category         :	Category of the City (A,B,C)
# - StayInCurrentCityYears:	Number of years stay in current city
# - Marital_Status        :	Marital Status
# - ProductCategory       :	Product Category (Masked)
# - Purchase              :	Purchase Amount

# - Is our sample size big enough ? 
#     - As we can see that our **sampling distribution is normally distributed**,after n = 30, but as per the difference in the enpirical standard error and theoritical std erro, we can safey take any sample range from (200 - 600)
#     - Checking **confidence intervals, if the range of interval estimates is high**,  we have increased the sample size.

# - The mean of the purchase done by All Females will lie in the range (8449.13, 9024.43) with 95% confidence
# - The mean of the purchase done by All Females will lie in the range (8358.14, 9115.42) with 99% confidence

# **As the confidence percentage inreases, the spread i.e the difference between the upper limit and lower limit also increases.
# Also, we can conclude that, mean purchase done by men is higher than females as we hardly see any overlap, the Walmart management should focus more on individual category and should cater to specific needs for boths categories differently.**
